    "Simple models (i.e. models that produce simple decision boundaries) have high bias and adding a lot more data won't dramatically increase the accuracy of the model. Such models are said to underfit the data because they do not have the ability to use the data available to better infer the true decision boundary. \n",

    "The problem is we don't have an infinite amount of data and we must make a tradeoff between bias and variance. By plotting the cross validation error rates attained from moving from a simple model to a complex model (in terms of the hyperparameters of the model), we can see where the inflection point between bias and variance occurs. \n",

    "When the model is simple, it misses a lot of the signal and thus the error is high.
