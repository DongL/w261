Hi! My name is Jason Sanchez. I live in San Francisco. I started MIDS in Fall 2015 and expect to finish in Summer 2017. Why so long? I am a cofounder of a startup that is using data science to modernize the insurance industry. 

After completing the first week of class, I am extremely hopeful that this class will define my Berkeley experience. This class seems difficult, but extremely worth the effort and I would like to feel comfortable tackling big data problems in production environments.
